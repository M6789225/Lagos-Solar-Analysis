# Lagos Solar Potential Analysis
This project analyzes rooftop solar potential in Lagos using a dataset of building characteristics. Key insights include:
- Average energy potential across various building types.
- Correlations between surface area, tilt, and energy potential.
- Recommendations for optimal solar installation.

## Visualizations
- **Correlation Matrix**: Shows relationships between variables.
- **Energy Potential by Building Type**: Highlights the most efficient types.

## Tools
- Python: `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- Data cleaning and visualization scripts are provided in `analysis.py`.

## Setup
To replicate this project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib`.
3. Run `analysis.py`.
